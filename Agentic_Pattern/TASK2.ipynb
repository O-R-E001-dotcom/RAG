      "Step 1 result: ### Argan Oil: Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "**Origins:**\n",
      "Argan oil is derived from the nuts of the argan tree (Argania spinosa), which is native to Morocco. The tree is well-adapted to the arid climate of the region and has been a vital part of the local ecosystem and economy for centuries. The Berber people of Morocco have traditionally used argan oil for various purposes, including cooking, skin care, and medicinal applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Production Process:**\n",
      "1. **Harvesting:** The argan nuts are harvested from the fruit of the argan tree. The fruit is typically collected in the summer months when it ripens.\n",
      "2. **Shelling:** The outer pulp of the fruit is removed to access the hard-shelled nuts inside. This process can be labor-intensive, as the nuts are often cracked open by hand.\n",
      "3. **Extraction:** The oil is extracted from the nuts through two main methods:\n",
      "   - **Cold Pressing:** This method involves mechanically pressing the nuts to extract the oil without the use of heat, preserving its nutritional and beneficial properties. This is the method used for cosmetic-grade argan oil.\n",
      "   - **Roasting:** For culinary argan oil, the nuts are roasted before pressing, which gives the oil a distinct nutty flavor.\n",
      "4. **Filtering:** The extracted oil is filtered to remove any remaining solids, resulting in a clear, golden oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Uses:**\n",
